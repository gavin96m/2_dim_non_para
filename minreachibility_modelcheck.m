%This code is used to the IMDP verification for two-dimensional case 
%without considering the rewards and costs.

%1. The inputs M_lo, M_up are two matrices, which entries are the lower and upper bound of 
%transition probability under different motions a_1, a_2, a_3,...,a_k i.e., Act={a_1,a_2,a_3,...,a_k}. 
%****Important: Matrix M_lo should be the form: nmk x nm. If the state does not have some actions
%just keep the row of the specific action whole zero.

%2. In addition, we also need to reorder the partition (the matrix form for two dimension, 
%cubic form for three dimension) into the order similar with S1, S2,...,Sn, i.e., Sta={S1,S2,...}.

%3. The satisfication set phi also should be the input, so that at each step we
%need to check whether each state in S_total can satisfy the satification.
%For example, We should input the original whole states set S_total, the
%target set S_targ which satisfies the specific specification, the releted
%unwanted set which can be deduced from S_total and S_targ. Important
%notice (for the satisfication set): Here we just consider the model
%checking problem, hence in this code the satification set is the value
%range of states of the considering system. S_nev is S_total/(S_targ
%union S_ini), S_quest=S_total/(S_targ union S_nev). S_ini is the initial
%set of our problem. In this code, we only consider the one initial point
%q_ini. *****The above S_total, S_targ, S_nev, S_quest are all vector (i.e., mnx1), since our
%problem is two-dimensional and we will rearrange the matrix into a vector by the reshape(A',1,[]). 
%****Here, S_total is including all states, and the set of all reordering
%states from partitionã€‚ Thus, S_total is a vector. The same as S_targ and
%S_nev.
%****Important: If we want to use this code, we need to reorder the
%partitioned state space (for example, for two dimension, the partitioned state space is
%a matrix. For one dimension, it is a point set). S_total should be the
%form {s_1,s_2,...,s_mn}

%****action series: is the action required to achieve the minimum
%probability at different steps. Thus, action_series is kx1 vector.
%****q_ini: is the initial state, which here will label as the real number
%k means the finite steps of the path initiating from the S_ini to S_targ
%within k steps.
